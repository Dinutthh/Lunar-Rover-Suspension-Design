# Lunar-Rover-Suspension-Design
Mechatronics engineering design project from RMIT. Individual work on a lunar rover rocker‑bogie suspension: concept generation, CAD in SolidWorks, comparison of alternatives, cross‑link differential design, and integration into rover sub‑assembly. Received 100/100 and demonstrates early engineering design skills.
