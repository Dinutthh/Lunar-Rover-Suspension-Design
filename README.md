# Lunar Rover Rocker‑Bogie Suspension (OENG1250)

This repository contains my individual design work for the suspension subsystem of a lunar rover, completed in first year Mechatronics Engineering at RMIT University. The goal was to design a rocker‑bogie suspension that allows a 20 kg rover to traverse uneven lunar terrain while meeting strict constraints on mass, dimensions and ground clearance.

## Project overview

- **Course:** OENG1250 – Introduction to Engineering Design  
- **University:** RMIT University  
- **Component:** Suspension system for a lunar regolith transport rover  
- **Tools used:** SolidWorks 2025, basic engineering design methods  
- **Grade:** 100/100 for the individual design journal  

## Design problem

The rover needed to:

- Fit within an envelope of 300 mm (H) × 500 mm (W) × 500 mm (L)  
- Maintain ground clearance greater than 200 mm  
- Use wheels within a specified diameter range  
- Use realistic engineering materials suitable for a space‑style environment  

My task was to design the rocker‑bogie suspension that supports the rover, keeps it stable on rocky and powdery regolith, and interfaces correctly with the drive system and body.

## My responsibilities

- Defined the suspension problem, including key constraints and performance goals.  
- Researched rocker‑bogie geometries and differential mechanisms used in planetary rovers.  
- Sketched and modelled multiple suspension concepts in SolidWorks.  
- Compared alternative suspension shapes (square vs curved rocker‑bogie) using pros/cons and mass properties.  
- Selected a curved rocker‑bogie configuration to reduce mass while maintaining good load distribution.  
- Investigated differential options (mechanical gear differential vs cross‑link bar) and chose a cross‑link bar for simplicity and robustness.  
- Created preliminary and detailed CAD models, including the suspension assembly and its interfaces with wheels, body and drive struts.  
- Contributed to the rover sub‑assembly to check clearances and fit with adjacent subsystems.  

 ## What is in this repository


- `docs/` – Exported pages from the design journal.  
- `images/` – JPEG renders of the CAD model. 

## Key design decisions

- **Curved rocker‑bogie arms:** Chosen over a square design to reduce mass and improve load sharing between wheels while keeping manufacturability reasonable.  
- **Cross‑link differential bar:** Selected instead of a gear‑based differential to simplify manufacturing, improve reliability and match approaches used in real rover designs.  
- **Integrated detailed design:** Refined attachment points, material choices and component geometry to ensure the suspension fit within the rover constraints and worked with the drive system.  

## What I learned

Through this project I gained experience in:

- Applying a structured engineering design process from problem definition to detailed design.  
- Using CAD (SolidWorks) to iterate on concepts, check constraints and evaluate mass properties.  
- Considering trade‑offs between weight, strength, manufacturability and reliability.  
- Collaborating in a team design project while taking ownership of one subsystem.
